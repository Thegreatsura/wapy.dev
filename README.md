## Getting Started

Requirements:
  - Resend API key: for handling authentication emails and email notifications

  - Github OAuth keys (ID and Secret): for enabling Github login.

  - Google OAuth keys (ID and Secret): for enabling Google login.

Download or copy `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example` files from the repository.

Before everything, you will need to setup the environment variables. Please take a look at the `.env.example` file to see what variables you need to set.

The setup script `setup.sh` will help you by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and generating some of the environment variables automatically. To automatically generate the `.env` file, you can download/copy the file `scripts/setup.sh` and run the script via following commands:

```bash
# On Linux
chmod +x ./scripts/setup.sh && ./scripts/setup.sh
# or
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:23.6-alpine sh -c "apk add --no-cache openssl su-exec && su-exec $(id -u):$(id -g) ./scripts/setup.sh"

# On Windows
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app node:23.6-alpine sh -c "apk add --no-cache openssl && ./scripts/setup.sh"
```

### Production Setup

Run docker compose to start the server.

```bash
docker compose -p wapydev up -d
```

The docker compose file includes the database and server. After successful deployment, you can visit your domain URL to see the application.

### Development Setup

Run docker compose to start the server.

```bash
docker compose -p wapydev-dev -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```
