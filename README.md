## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

1. On first run, you need to setup the environment variables. Please take a look
at the `.env.example` file to see what variables you need to set.

    - The setup script will copy `.env.example` to `.env` and generate some of the
environment variables automatically. To automatically generate the `.env` file, you can run the `setup.sh` script via following commands:

    ```bash
    # On Linux
    chmod +x ./scripts/setup.sh && ./scripts/setup.sh
    # or
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:23.5-alpine sh -c "apk add --no-cache openssl su-exec && su-exec $(id -u):$(id -g) ./scripts/setup.sh"

    # On Windows
    docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app node:23.5-alpine sh -c "apk add --no-cache openssl && ./scripts/setup.sh"
    ```

    - Configure authentication keys (Github and Google) and Resend API key in the `.env` file.

      - Github and Google OAuth keys (ID and Secret) are for enabling social login.

      - Resend API key (`RESEND_API_KEY`) is for handling authentication emails and email notifications.

1. Run `docker compose -p wapydev up -d` to start the database and server. Default environment is `production`, but you can change it to `development` if you want to, via `NODE_ENV` variable in the `.env` file.

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` or your domain URL.

### Database Backup and Restore

You can backup the database by running the `backup.sh` script.

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

You can restore the database by running the `restore.sh` script.

```bash
./scripts/restore.sh
```
